Vulnerabilities in BadLotteryGame

Lack of Access Control: The contract does not have any access control 
mechanism to restrict unauthorized access. 
This means anyone can call the addNewPlayer() function and become a player, 
potentially manipulating the game.

Use of Block Timestamp for Randomness: The pickWinner() function uses the block 
timestamp to generate a random number. 
However, block timestamps can be manipulated by miners to some extent, allowing 
them to potentially influence the selection of the winner.

Vulnerable Payout Mechanism: The distributePrize() function distributes the prize 
to the winners without checking the 
total balance of the contract, making it vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. 
Additionally, the for loop in the function 
should use the less than operator instead of the less than or equal to operator 
in order to avoid an out-of-bounds array access.

No Validation of Input Parameters: The addNewPlayer() function does not validate 
the input parameter _playerAddress, 
which means that anyone can potentially pass an invalid address as a parameter and 
cause the contract to revert.

No Withdrawal Functionality: The contract does not include any functionality for 
players to withdraw their funds, 
which means they are unable to withdraw their stake if they choose to stop playing.

No SafeMath Library: The contract does not use any safe math library, which could 
lead to integer overflow or underflow issues.
